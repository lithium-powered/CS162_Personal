.init: Executable instructions that contribute to a single initialization function for the executable or shared object containing the section.
.text: The text or executable instructions of a program.
.dynamic: dynamic linking information.
.data: Initialized data that contribute to the program's memory image.

The stack is growing down, as in the subsequent stack frames are in lower memory addresses than the previous.

The stack frame is 0x30 bytes large.

The heap is in memory address 0x2085010 and it is growing up, as the next allocations of the heap memory is larger than previous ones.

The memory areas are not contiguous, the memory allocation is 100 bytes but the different between the two allocations is larger than 100 bytes.
